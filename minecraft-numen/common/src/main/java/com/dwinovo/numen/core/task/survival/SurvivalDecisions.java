/**
 * The PURE decision core of the autonomous survival layer — the "should I take the
 * body, and how hard" math, split out of the chains so it can be unit-tested
 * headless (no Minecraft). Each method takes only primitives polled from the
 * vanilla {@code ServerPlayer} state (food level, health, fall distance, whether a
 * threat is present / a tool is held) and returns either a spike priority ABOVE
 * {@link TaskChain#LLM_BASE_PRIORITY} (so the chain preempts the LLM task) or
 * {@link Float#NEGATIVE_INFINITY} (dormant).
 *
 * <h2>Priority ranking (why these magnitudes)</h2>
 * A falling body is the most imminent death, so MLG outranks everything; an active
 * mob is next; hunger (a slow drain) next; being stuck (annoying, not lethal) is
 * the lowest survival concern and must never outrank fighting or eating. All sit
 * above the LLM base (0) so any firing survival concern preempts the task:
 * <pre>  MLG(10) &gt; breath(6) &gt; mob-defense(5) &gt; food-regen(4) &gt; food-hunger(3) &gt; unstuck(2) &gt; llm(0)</pre>
