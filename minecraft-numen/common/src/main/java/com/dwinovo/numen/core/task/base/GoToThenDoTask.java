/**
 * The "walk within reach, then act" shape shared by every task that navigates to a
 * target and then does one bounded thing there ({@code build},
 * {@code interact_at}, a single melee_attack engagement, …). It collapses
 * the identical nav-drive-then-act loop those tasks each hand-wrote onto three small
 * abstract hooks, leaving each concrete task to describe only its target, its
 * arrival test, and its action.
 *
 * <h2>Shape</h2>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link #onStart()} builds the nav from {@link #buildNav()}.</li>
 *   <li>each tick: if {@link #reached()} → {@link #act()}; otherwise drive the nav —
 *       {@code RUNNING}/{@code ARRIVED} keep going, {@code FAILED} routes through
 *       {@link #handleNavFailure(FailureType, String)}.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Recovery hook</h2>
 * The default {@link #handleNavFailure} is today's behaviour: report the nav's
 * cause via {@link #fail} and terminate. This is the seam a later stage overrides
 * to attach a {@link RecoveryLadder} — swap "give up on a nav failure" for "try the
 * next rung" WITHOUT touching the loop or the concrete tasks.
 *
 * @param <R> the concrete {@link TaskRecord} subtype for this task.
