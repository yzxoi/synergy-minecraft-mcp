# Skill: tier_progression

Phase 1 of the dragon route. You need diamond tools before you can mine obsidian and survive the Nether. Skip nothing here — under-geared Nether trips end in a lost inventory.

## Done when (verify with `get_self_status`)

- **Diamond pickaxe** (required for obsidian) and **diamond sword**, equipped as appropriate
- **Iron-or-better armor** worn (full iron is fine; diamond chestplate first if diamonds allow)
- **Bow + 32 arrows** (the dragon's crystals must be shot; blazes are safest shot too)
- **32+ cooked food** (cooked_beef / cooked_porkchop preferred)
- **64+ cobblestone** kept in inventory at all times — navigation consumes it as scaffold when bridging/pillaring. This is a REAL cost: climbing back out of a deep mine can eat 20-40 cobblestone (one per pillar block), so `mine` may report `gathered=N` while your backpack holds fewer than N of a scaffold-typed item. That is the pathfinder working, not a counting bug — always re-check `get_self_status` after a mining trip, and convert/store scaffold-typed materials (smelt ores, craft planks/ingots) before traveling far; iron ingots and diamonds are never consumed.

## Tool tier chain

`mine` checks your held tool: a too-low tier breaks the block with **no drop**. `equip_item` the right pickaxe before mining, and `inspect_block` when unsure.

The same rule gates navigation: **`goto` only digs through blocks your held tool can harvest.** Descending into stone with a sword in hand fails with "no path" — travel with the pickaxe in your main hand; switch to a weapon only for the fight, then switch back.

| Tier | Unlocks mining | Recipe |
|---|---|---|
| Hand | logs, dirt, gravel | — |
| Wooden pickaxe | stone, coal | 3 planks + 2 sticks |
| Stone pickaxe | iron, lapis | 3 cobblestone + 2 sticks |
| Iron pickaxe | diamond, gold, redstone | 3 iron ingots + 2 sticks |
| Diamond pickaxe | obsidian | 3 diamonds + 2 sticks |

## Where ores live (1.21+ worldgen)

Below Y 0 every ore is its **deepslate variant** — always pass both ids to `mine` / `scan_blocks` (e.g. `diamond_ore` *and* `deepslate_diamond_ore`).

| Resource | Target Y | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Coal | Y 90–136 | Surface hillsides are fastest |
| Iron | Y 16 (or mountain surface Y 200+) | Drops `raw_iron`, smelt it |
| **Diamond** | **Y -58 to -59** | Highest density; lava pools at this depth — mine carefully |

## Recommended order

1. **Wood**: `mine` 8+ logs (any `*_log`; hand works) → craft planks → sticks → a `wooden_pickaxe`. Crafting = `lookup_recipe` then `transfer` the ingredients into a grid (load the `containers` skill for the how). 2×2 recipes (planks, sticks) use your own grid; a 3×3 (the pickaxe) needs a crafting table — once you have planks, craft one, `build` it (a single cell), then `interact_at` to open it. Remember the table's coordinates and reuse it.
2. **Stone**: `equip_item(wooden_pickaxe)` → `mine(stone, 20)` (drops cobblestone) → craft a `stone_pickaxe`, `stone_sword`, and a `furnace`.
3. **Food**: scan cows/pigs/chickens and pass their runtime IDs to `melee_attack` (6+ total) → cook the raw meat: `interact_at` a furnace, `transfer` the raw food into the top slot + fuel (coal or planks) below, then `wait` and `transfer` the cooked food out (see the `containers` skill). Always cook; raw meat barely heals.
4. **Iron**: descend (`goto(x, 16, z)` — navigation digs its own way down) → `equip_item(stone_pickaxe)` → `mine(iron_ore, deepslate_iron_ore, 10+)` → smelt `raw_iron` (same furnace flow) → craft an `iron_pickaxe`, `iron_sword`, then armor as ingots allow (helmet 5, chestplate 8, leggings 7, boots 4).
5. **Diamonds**: `goto(x, -58, z)` → `equip_item(iron_pickaxe)` → `mine(deepslate_diamond_ore, diamond_ore, 5+)`. Minimum 5 (pickaxe 3 + sword 2); 8+ if you also want a chestplate later. Watch HP near lava.
6. **Diamond gear**: craft a `diamond_pickaxe` + `diamond_sword` on the crafting table. Keep the pickaxe in hand for travel and mining; equip the sword only when a fight starts.
7. **Bow + arrows**: bow = 3 sticks + 3 string (scan spiders at night and pass their runtime IDs to `melee_attack` for string); arrows = 1 flint + 1 stick + 1 feather → 4 (flint drops from `mine(gravel)` at ~10%, feathers from chickens). Target 32 arrows — more is comfort, not requirement; melee + food covers what arrows don't.
8. **Top up**: 32+ cooked food, 64+ cobblestone. Re-run `get_self_status` against the "done when" list.

## Enchanting

You cannot operate an enchanting table (GUI block). If your owner offers to enchant your gear — Sharpness on the sword, Power on the bow, Efficiency on the pickaxe — accept before moving on; it meaningfully raises dragon-fight odds. Never plan an enchanting step for yourself.
