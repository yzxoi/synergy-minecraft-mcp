/**
 * An immutable snapshot of the loaded chunks near a level's companions — the server-side equivalent of
 * Baritone's {@code createThreadSafeCopy()} of the chunk provider. Built on
 * the main thread once per tick ({@link PathCaches#serverTick}) and read by the planner (off-thread
 * from P-C). It holds live {@link LevelChunk} references, so a lookup reads the LIVE section palette
 * (Baritone's {@code useTheRealWorld}) — exact for loaded terrain. We tolerate the rare race of reading
 * a palette the main thread is concurrently resizing (the reader catches it and yields AIR; the
 * executor re-costs live and replans), exactly the trade Baritone makes.
 *
 * <p>Never mutated after construction, so a worker reading the map structure can't race a writer — only
 * the shared chunk CONTENTS are live. A fresh snapshot is published (via {@link PathCaches}'s
 * {@link java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap}) each tick; an in-flight search keeps the snapshot it
 * started with.
