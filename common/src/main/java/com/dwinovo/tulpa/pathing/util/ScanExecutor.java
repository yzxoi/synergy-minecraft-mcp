 * A single shared background thread for off-thread world scans — the analogue of

 * chunk section palettes; doing it here keeps the server tick free of the
 * {@code (2r)³}-cell sweep. One daemon thread (scans are fast and serialising
 * them across companions avoids piling work on the CPU); results are advisory
 * and re-validated on the main thread before anything is mined.
