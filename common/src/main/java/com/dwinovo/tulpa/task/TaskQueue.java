/**
 * Per-entity FIFO queue of {@link TaskRecord}s, plus an outbox of completed
 * records awaiting agent-loop pickup.
 *
 * <h2>Threading model</h2>
 * Every operation is called from the server main thread:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link #enqueue} runs from {@code ExecuteToolPayload.handle} —
 *       the C→S packet handler is delivered on the server main thread by the
 *       network layer (see {@code ExecuteToolPayload.handle}'s javadoc).</li>
 *   <li>{@link #peekMatching}, {@link #pollMatching}, {@link #complete} all
 *       run from {@code GoalSelector.tick} (canUse / start / stop) via the
 *       matching {@link LlmTaskGoal}.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #drainCompleted} runs from the companion tick dispatcher
 *       once per tick, shipping completed records back to the owning player as
 *       {@code TaskResultPayload} for the client-side agent loop to consume.</li>
 * </ul>
 * Plain non-thread-safe collections are deliberate — adding {@code synchronized}
 * or {@code ConcurrentLinkedDeque} would only mask a missed thread hop.
 *
 * <h2>Why peek + poll instead of poll alone</h2>
 * Vanilla's {@code GoalSelector.canUse()} is non-mutating by contract — it
 * gets called twice per goal-evaluation cycle and shouldn't dequeue work that
 * a later flag-conflict check might reject. We peek in {@code canUse} and
 * only commit (poll) in {@code start}.
 *
 * <h2>Why match by tool name</h2>
 * Each atomic-task Goal subclass registers for one tool name. When a record
 * sits at the head with a tool name that no registered Goal handles, vanilla
 * never picks it up — it'd block the queue indefinitely. The agent loop
 * intercepts unknown tool names at parse time (before they ever become
 * records), but the matching API guards against the corner case where a
 * Goal is removed mid-game.
