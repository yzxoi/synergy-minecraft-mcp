/**
 * Lifecycle state of a {@link TaskRecord}.
 *
 * <p>Transitions are tick-driven and one-way: a record starts at
 * {@link #PENDING}, the matching {@code LlmTaskGoal} flips it to
 * {@link #RUNNING} when it picks the record up, and lands on exactly one of
 * the four terminal states ({@link #SUCCESS}, {@link #FAILED}, {@link #TIMEOUT},
 * {@link #CANCELLED}) once the Goal stops.
 *
 * <p>The agent loop only ever observes terminal states (it drains the queue's
 * outbox), so callers outside the Goal don't need to handle {@code PENDING} /
 * {@code RUNNING} explicitly.
