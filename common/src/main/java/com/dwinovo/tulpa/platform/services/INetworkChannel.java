/**
 * Cross-loader networking surface. Wraps Fabric's
 * {@code PayloadTypeRegistry} / {@code ServerPlayNetworking} /
 * {@code ClientPlayNetworking} and NeoForge's
 * {@code RegisterPayloadHandlersEvent} / {@code PacketDistributor} so feature
 * code in {@code common} can declare a payload, its codec, and its handler
 * once and have it work on both loaders.
 *
 * <h2>Payload lifecycle (C→S)</h2>
 * <ol>
 *   <li>Define a record implementing {@link CustomPacketPayload} with a
 *       public {@code Type<T>} and {@code StreamCodec}.</li>
 *   <li>Call {@link #registerClientToServer} once from {@code TulpaNetwork.register}.</li>
 *   <li>Client sends via {@link #sendToServer}; handler runs on the server
 *       main thread.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <h2>Payload lifecycle (S→C)</h2>
 * <ol>
 *   <li>Same payload definition.</li>
 *   <li>Call {@link #registerServerToClient} once from {@code TulpaNetwork.register}.</li>
 *   <li>Server sends via {@link #sendToPlayer}; handler runs on the client
 *       main thread.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <h2>Threading guarantee</h2>
 * Handlers (both directions) are dispatched on the receiving side's main
 * thread. Common code doesn't need to schedule.
 *
 * <h2>Why a single combined interface</h2>
 * Versus separate {@code IClientChannel} / {@code IServerChannel}: feature
 * code in common often needs to register both directions for one feature
 * (request + reply). Single channel lets {@code TulpaNetwork.register}
 * stay a flat list of registrations.
