 * per-movement EXECUTION is input-driving ({@link InputDriver}) + the player's

 *
 * <p>Each movement runs as: clear its {@code toBreak} obstructions (the native
 * {@link BlockDigger} — {@code handleBlockBreakAction} START/STOP, survival
 * timed, drops fall and the player picks them up natively), place its
 * {@code toPlace} scaffold, then step toward
 * {@code dest} (face it, push forward; hop for ascend/pillar/parkour) until the
 * feet reach it. This is a first cut tuned for compilation + wiring; movement
