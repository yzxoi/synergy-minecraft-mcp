 * GLOBAL per-tick budget for every sliced world search on the server —
 * structure locating ({@link LocateStructureTaskGoal}), biome locating
 * ({@link LocateBiomeTaskGoal}) and long-range block scans
 * ({@link ScanBlocksJob}). The Explorer's Compass {@code WorldWorkerManager}
 * model: total search cost per tick is a server constant, independent of how
 * many companions are searching at once — per-task budgets would stack
 * linearly with pet count.
 *
 * <h2>Fairness</h2>
 * First-come-first-served within a tick (entities tick in a stable order), so
 * concurrent searches effectively serialize: the first finishes in a few
 * ticks, then the next drains the pool. For companion-scale concurrency
 * that's strictly better than splitting the pool — total latency is the same
 * and the implementation stays trivial. Revisit with round-robin only if
 * dozens of simultaneous searches ever become real.
 *
 * <h2>Threading</h2>
 * Server main thread only, like everything in the task layer. The tick stamp
 * uses {@link MinecraftServer#getTickCount()} (monotonic, unaffected by
 * {@code /tick freeze}) to reset the pool exactly once per server tick.
