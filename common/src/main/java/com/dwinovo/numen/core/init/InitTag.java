 * here so the key's identifier exists in one place only — rename or repath in
 * this file and every consumer follows. These are core's tags (namespace
 * {@code numen}), not the engine's: pathfinding scaffolding and protected blocks
 * are tool-pack concerns.
 *
 * <h2>Why not derive at runtime</h2>
 * Tags are referenced from pathfinder hot paths where a fresh
 * {@link Identifier#fromNamespaceAndPath} per call would allocate. Caching
 * the {@link TagKey} as a {@code static final} field amortises that cost
 * and gives the JIT a constant pool reference.
